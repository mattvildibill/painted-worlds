# Vercel deployment

Production domain: https://painted.mattvildibill.com
Source: https://github.com/mattvildibill/painted-worlds
Production branch: `main`.

`vercel.json` records the framework, build and output settings. This repository is connected to its own Vercel project; retain that Git connection. Vercel builds each push to `main`; other branches receive previews. No manual asset copy or Sites publishing is needed. The production branch is `main`. Migration was completed on September 29, 2026; Vercel reported successful deployments for all seven repositories.

Use Node.js 24. Run `npm ci` when a lockfile is present, then `npm run build`. No application secrets or database are required. Never commit `.env` files or Vercel credentials.

The portfolio launches one iframe at a time. Each project owns its runtime and assets. The embed bridge validates its parent origin; closing the viewer destroys the iframe and stops its work. Headers allow embedding from the portfolio. Original project attributions and model boundaries are retained.

Existing ChatGPT-hosted versions have not been deleted or redirected. They remain active in Sites for existing shared links. New updates should be made in these GitHub repositories and deployed by Vercel; the legacy copies are retained for compatibility. If redirects are later installed on old hosts, preserve paths and query parameters.

## Assets

`asset-bundles/` stores lossless, SHA-256-verified assets recovered from the original source. `npm run assets:restore` restores them to their original paths; the build runs it automatically. Text source remains directly editable. Restore refuses to overwrite a modified local asset. To replace an asset, update and repack the bundles with `python scripts/pack-assets.py`; commit the resulting bundles and manifest.
